## ‚ùì Q&A

### Why don't I use multiprocessing to download multiple images at once?

I do not want to burden the host of the server

### Will there be support for other sources?

Maybe. I have no current plans, but I made the script flexable for more sources. If there are any requests, feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/YelloNolo/asuratoon-dl/discussions).
